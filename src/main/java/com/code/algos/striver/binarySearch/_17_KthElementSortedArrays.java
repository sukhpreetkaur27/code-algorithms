/**
 * Given two sorted arrays arr1 and arr2 of size N and M respectively and an element K. 
 * The task is to find the element that would be at the kâ€™th position of the final sorted array.
 

Example 1:

Input:
arr1[] = {2, 3, 6, 7, 9}
arr2[] = {1, 4, 8, 10}
k = 5
Output:
6
Explanation:
The final sorted array would be -
1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10
The 5th element of this array is 6.
Example 2:
Input:
arr1[] = {100, 112, 256, 349, 770}
arr2[] = {72, 86, 113, 119, 265, 445, 892}
k = 7
Output:
256
Explanation:
Final sorted array is - 72, 86, 100, 112,
113, 119, 256, 265, 349, 445, 770, 892
7th element of this array is 256.

Your Task:  
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function kthElement() which takes the arrays arr1[], arr2[], 
its size N and M respectively and an integer K as inputs and returns the element at the Kth position.


Expected Time Complexity: O(Log(N) + Log(M))
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(Log (N))


Constraints:
1 <= N, M <= 106
1 <= arr1i, arr2i < INT_MAX
1 <= K <= N+M
